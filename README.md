# Zabih - mark13 - Birthday Palindrome App

Created a Birthday Palindrome App using VanillaJS to show if Date Of Birth of the user is palindrome or not. 

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward and forward. In this App, we will consider six date formats - ddmmyyyy, mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy, mmddyy, yymmdd, to check if the user's birthdate is palindrome or not.

Technologies used are:
1. HTML
1. CSS
1. JavaScript
